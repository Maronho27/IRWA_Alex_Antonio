# IRWA_Alex_Antonio

For running the first part of our search engine, you should run each of the cells of our Jupyter Notebook in order.

For loading each dataset, you should save the datasets in the following directory in your Google Drive:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_1:Text_Processing/Hurricane_Ian_Corpus/data/, and first run the first cell for mounting the drive and then the
fourth and fifth cell for loading the .json and .csv file respectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this second part of the project we have decided to merge what we did in the first lab and what we did in the second one in a single 
file, in order to make the procedure of correcting our work easier, as in this way, our teacher only need to run the file 
IRWA-2022-part-2 for obtaining the final result, instead of running both of them. We also have distinguished between the old part of
the code (the one of part 1) and the new part of the code (the one of part 2) by adding the text "Here starts the second part of the
project" as can clearly be seen in our Google Colab file.

Apart from that, again, they will need to save the datasets of the first lab in the drive directory:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_1:Text_Processing/Hurricane_Ian_Corpus/data/ and the new file should be in:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_2:Indexing_and_Evaluation/evaluation_gt.csv, and they must accept mounting the drive and install any imported
library if they do not have any of them installed.

Finally, teachers must introduce a query at the last cell of the section "Print the ranked documents for a given query" or otherwise the
code will not finish the execution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this third part of the project, we have reused again some cell of code from previous
parts of the project (load datasets, text pre-processing and index creation from the first
part of the project and tf-idf ranking and selection of queries from the second part of
the project). Again, just mention that we have decided to copy this cells in the part 3
Google Colab file, instead of make the teachers coordinate the different files of the 
three parts of the project for obtaining the results, what would have been much more 
complicated.

Apart from this we want to comment that teachers running our code would need to save the 
datasets of the first lab in the drive directory:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_1:Text_Processing/Hurricane_Ian_Corpus/data/ and that they must 
accept mounting the drive and install any imported library if they do not have any of them
installed, or otherwise, the code would crack at some point.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this fourth part of the project, we have a total of 7 Python files, 3 CSS files and 8
HTML files, so due to this, our teachers should download all of them before executing our
code. Apart from that they also need to download the JSON where we have our tweets and the
CSV with the name of the tweets. Apart from that, for running our code the teachers would
need to run the Python file IRWA-2022-part.py which is our equivalent to the web_app.py
file that they provided us, and search in their browser localhost:8088 in order to see our
web application. Apart from that, once they have searched localhost:8088 in their browser
our inverted index, tf, df and idf would be created, and due to this they would need to 
wait a couple of minutes before seeing something in our webpage and creation the inverted
index, the tf, the df and the idf takes a time.

Apart from this, our teachers should install all the imported dictionaries used during the
lab as otherwise the code would crack at some point.
