For running the first part of our search engine, you should run each of the cells of our Jupyter Notebook in order.

For loading each dataset, you should save the datasets in the following directory in your Google Drive:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_1:Text_Processing/Hurricane_Ian_Corpus/data/, and first run the first cell for mounting the drive and then the
fourth and fifth cell for loading the .json and .csv file respectively.
