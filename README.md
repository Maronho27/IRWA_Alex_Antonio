# IRWA_Alex_Antonio

For running the first part of our search engine, you should run each of the cells of our Jupyter Notebook in order.

For loading each dataset, you should save the datasets in the following directory in your Google Drive:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_1:Text_Processing/Hurricane_Ian_Corpus/data/, and first run the first cell for mounting the drive and then the
fourth and fifth cell for loading the .json and .csv file respectively.

For this second part of the project we have decided to merge what we did in the first lab and what we did in the second one in a single 
file, in order to make the procedure of correcting our work easier, as in this way, our teacher only need to run the file 
IRWA-2022-part-2 for obtaining the final result, instead of running both of them.

Apart from that, again, they will need to save the datasets of the first lab in the drive directory:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_1:Text_Processing/Hurricane_Ian_Corpus/data/ and the new file should be in:
drive/MyDrive/IRWA/Part_2:Indexing_and_Evaluation/evaluation_gt.csv, and they must accept mounting the drive and install any imported
library if they do not have any of them installed.
